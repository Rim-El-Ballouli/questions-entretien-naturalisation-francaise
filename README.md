[AnkiApp](https://www.ankiapp.com) uses an advanced algorithm developed and refined by neuroscientis to help fascilitate your learning by prioritizing the flashcard depending on previous performance evaluation.

Each flashcard is composed of a **front** and **back** side. Each front side contains a question and the back side contains the answer. Once you start reviewing, AnkiApp will present you with the front side of the flashcards. Answer the question orally and then review the answer on the back side. Below is a sample flashcard's front and back side.
